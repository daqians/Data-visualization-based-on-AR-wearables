# Data-visualization-based-on-AR-wearables

# Introduction:
With the advancement of computers and the rapid development of data visualization technology, the processing speed of data has been greatly accelerated, making it possible to make effective use of the enormous data generated during work and learning. After discussion, we pointed out that augmented reality technology does not require abstraction, intuitive expression, and realistic effects. It considers it to be extremely advantageous in data visualization and proposes a 3D data visualization project based on augmented reality via wearable devices. Augmented-reality-based data visualization technology can superimpose virtual information such as computer-generated graphics images of reality. We hope that through this project, many of the charts that display general effects on a two-dimensional plane will be displayed in three-dimensional charts, giving full play to augmented reality technology. The advantage of enabling the user to observe the 3D chart in a three-dimensional space by wearing a head-mounted display device (eg, Microsoft Hololens, etc.) in a three-dimensional manner, so that the viewer can more easily find out the information brought by the data to us. It is easier to observe the phenomena and laws that are difficult to observe in traditional methods and to make it easier to understand three-dimensional charts so as to better promote people's scientific research, work, and life.


Second, human-machine interaction is indispensable to better play the characteristics of augmented reality technology. In order to make the interaction between humans and electronic devices as natural and fluid as human-to-human communication, we communicate through gestures, voices, gazes, and other interactions, enabling users to perform data analysis on data charts.  Users can also modify the chart as needed. Of course, the modified data can also be synchronously transmitted back to the PC or iOS where the original data is provided, and timely data feedback can be implemented, thereby improving the timeliness and interactivity of the entire project.


Aiming at the research goal of this project, we have designed the following functions: 
: (1) design and implement a set of data visualization system based on augmented reality;
: (2) to support reading data from different platforms, such as PC end, the mobile terminal (such as iOS terminal, etc.); 
: (3) design an App at the moving end to achieve a two-dimensional chart display of data;
(4) implement 3D chart synchronization display on Hololens device.
(5) the human-computer interaction (including gestures, voice, gaze, etc.) at the Hololens end can be carried out in a multi-angle view, and the data in the chart can be modified.
(6) the data that is modified at the Hololens side can be updated to PC and mobile terminals synchronously.
